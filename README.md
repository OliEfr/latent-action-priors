### Code accompanying the latent action priors paper

🖥️ [Website with videos](https://sites.google.com/view/latent-action-priors) | 📄 [Paper]()

**How to use this repository**: Run `setup.sh` to setup the repository. `expert_demonstrations` contains the data and code to reproduce the single gait cycle expert demonstrations used in the paper. Files with `train_*` run the trainings conducted in the paper. For examples on how to use these training files and conduct experiments see `run.sh`.


Note: The recorded `.gif` videos of the agents sometimes show incorrect playback speeds as `.gif` only supports framerates of up to 50fps for most browsers. The video playback speeds on the accompanying website are correct.
